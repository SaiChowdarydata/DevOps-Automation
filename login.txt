: The branch is nothing but a logical folder/directory in git which allows us to store files/directories & commits.
         Branches are very cheap which means we can easily create & delete a branch and also there is not much storage cost associated with branches.
         Branches provide flexibility to segregate your work depending on the features.
         

eg :                             Tree(Git)
           |                       |  (directory)                |
