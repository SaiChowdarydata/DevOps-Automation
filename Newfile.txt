When you git clone, git fetch, gi
t pull, or git push to a remote repository usin\
g HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask f
or your GitHub username and password. When Git promp
ts you for your password, enter your personal access 
token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helpe
r like Git Credential Manager. Password-based authent
ication for Git has been rem
oved in favor of more secure au
thentication m
ethods. For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens."
